# Wedding Bells

Wedding Bells is a free blog theme for Kirby CMS (<http://getkirby.com>). Currently it supports two types of content: posts and pages. In the future I may add more functionality like photoblogging. Besides the basics the theme also includes:

- Responsive design
- Tags
- Categories
- Blueprints for Kirby Panel
